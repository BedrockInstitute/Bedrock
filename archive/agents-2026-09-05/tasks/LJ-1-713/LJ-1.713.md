# LJ-1.713: Below, from the placement and the identification as hypotheses

## HEAD

## THE OBLIGATION

Build ONE term in `agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/Probe713.agda`:

    below-closed : <`[LJ-1.697]`'s `Below`, via `[LJ-1.706]`'s green `below-from-place`, taking `Bound-in-tower` and `Identified` as HYPOTHESES>

Land nothing in `src/`.

**NAME ANY FILE THAT CANNOT TYPECHECK `.agda.txt`, NEVER `.agda`.** Conjunct 1
runs EVERY `.agda` under this task home.

## OBLIGATION NAMES
obligations = ["agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/Probe713.agda::below-closed"]

## SCOPE (write)
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/Probe713.agda
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/lj-1.713-report.md
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/review-of-below-closed.md
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-713/runs/

## PREMISES

1. **THE REDUCTION IS ALREADY GREEN AND MUST NOT BE REBUILT.** Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-706/Probe706.agda:78
2. **BOTH INPUTS ARE WRITTEN AS TYPES.** `Identified` and `Bound-in-tower` sit beside it. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-706/Probe706.agda:60
3. **THE ASSEMBLY ABOVE `Below` IS GREEN TOO.** `from-below` takes `Below` at every ordinal to `HierInStage`. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-697/Probe697.agda:81
4. **AND THE ASSEMBLY ABOVE THAT IS GREEN.** `CompletenessFrom` takes `SameHyp` and `HierInStage` to `Completeness`. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-679/Probe679.agda:94
5. **`SameHyp` IS PAID.** Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-709/Probe709.agda:67

## WHAT IS DELIVERED ALREADY

Every arrow on this chain except the two hypotheses. This obligation has supply 4 and its content is only the composition at the campaign's own frame.

## THE REASONING

Four green arrows and two open inputs. This writes the composition down ONCE, so
that the day both inputs land there is no assembly work left, and so that a hidden
frame mismatch between the four arrows is found now rather than then.

## W3, THE WIDEST UNMEASURED TERM

Whether the four arrows compose at one frame, or whether two of them want
different carriers. Estimate 40 to 110 lines, basis:
agents/tasks/LJ-1-706/Probe706.agda:78

## WHAT GO AND NO-GO EACH EARN

**GO** proves the chain from two hypotheses to `Completeness` is assembled and
leaves exactly two bills. **NO-GO** earns the frame mismatch, which is the last place
this route can still hide a surprise.

## YOUR ROLE (program-generated, do not edit)

**You write the Agda this brief names, and the probe it names (A21).** The mathematician specifies; you build it and make it typecheck. Your report is the other half of that channel, so write what the next brief will need.

**THE RATIO BAR IS LIVE AND IT IS 0.0123 SECONDS PER IN-FENCE LINE.** A green return at or above that rate is ESCALATED to a critic by row `sys-dd24-ratio-bar`, which is DD24 restored by amendment A10. The divisor is fact 7, the in-fence line count of THIS task's write scope, counted the ledger's way: non-blank lines inside ` ```agda ` fences. **A raw `.agda` probe carries no fence and counts 0**, so the bar cannot fire on a probe and it binds the moment you write a `.lagda.md` master under `src/`. Design for it rather than discovering it: the number comes from `dev/pod/table.toml` at brief build, and its measured basis is in `dev/ledger.toml [ratio]`.

## LAWS (program-generated, do not edit)

MANDATORY for kind `recon` (read-only: an audit, a design pass, a history dig. It writes a report and nothing else. The sweep C-42 demands is a recon action, so this is that law's home bundle.):

- **D-10. Price the truth of a recorded residue before pricing its proof**
  **Rule:** A residue recorded under the wall protocol names a TARGET, and a target can be false; before dispatching a discharge batch, spend the five minutes checking the target's truth at the intended generality (a Tarskian or cardinality obstruction is the usual killer), and record the corrected target beside the original.

- **C-22. A dispatched agent writes its deliverable incrementally, never at the end**
  **Rule:** When an agent's deliverable is a file, the brief must require it WRITTEN EARLY as a skeleton and filled incrementally, saving after each answer lands. An agent that researches for its whole budget and leaves the writing to the end returns nothing when the budget runs out, and its research dies with it. A partial dossier is a real deliverable; an unwritten perfect one is not.
  Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:2307
- **P-l. A statement may be ABOUT a concrete stage without dragging that stage's PRESENTATION into its type**
  **The law.** Being about a concrete position is not what costs. Naming a transparent construction in a statement's TYPE is. If the tower's stage values are `opaque` upstream, a theorem may quantify over, hypothesize about and conclude at `Sset ω` freely, because the stage is an ATOM to the elaborator and nothing unfolds. If instead the type mentions a transparent presentation, such as `⟪ sucV (...
  THIS IS AN EXCERPT. Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:2367
- **D-26. A well-founded key on a tower needs generation data, or it needs syntax**
  **Rule:** When a route must well-order a cumulative tower's stage, ask first what the stage's members CARRY. A stage built as the values of finitely many total operations carries its own generation data, so a well-founded key exists with NO syntax at all: the operation index, then the arguments, ordered recursively. A stage built as a definable power carries nothing: its members are sets, not c...
  THIS IS AN EXCERPT. Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:1735
- **C-42. A refutation measures the site it names, and it never measures how far that site extends**
  **Rule:** A refutation is a measurement of ONE site. It says the statement there is false. **It says nothing about how many other sites carry the same false shape.** So when a refutation lands, the next action is not the cure. **It is the sweep: search the tree for the shape, and report the COUNT before you price the cure.** A cure funded against the named site is priced against a number nobody...
