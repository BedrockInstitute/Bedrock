# LJ-1.683: describes, at a generic non-stage member

## HEAD
head_slot: coder
machine: shared
agda_tier: wide

## THE OBLIGATION

Build ONE term in `agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/Probe683.agda`:

    describes-generic : <`Describes σ y` for a GENERIC non-stage member `y` of `Lset σ`, not at one named pair>

Land nothing in `src/`.

**NAME ANY FILE THAT CANNOT TYPECHECK `.agda.txt`, NEVER `.agda`.** Conjunct 1
runs EVERY `.agda` under this task home.

## OBLIGATION NAMES
obligations = ["agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/Probe683.agda::describes-generic"]

## SCOPE (write)
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/Probe683.agda
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/lj-1.683-report.md
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/review-of-describes-generic.md
- agents/tasks/LJ-1-683/runs/

## PREMISES

1. **`[LJ-1.677]` DELIVERED IT AT ONE PAIR ONLY**, the first non-stage member, with `σ₃ = sucV (sucV (sucV ∅))` and `y₀ = ⁅ sucV ∅ ⁆s`. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-677/lj-1.677-report.md:1
2. `PowIter` is `Describes` collected over a finite iterate, so it needs every member and not one. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-668/lj-1.668-report.md:1
3. The stage case and the generic tautology are both paid, so only the non-stage generic case is open. Basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-674/Probe674.agda:72
4. Two chapters assume `powIter` under other names and the tree says nothing proves it. Basis: src/L/Coding/Bound.lagda.md:147

## WHAT IS DELIVERED ALREADY

The premises' own terms, each green in the task home or chapter it names. This
obligation has supply 0.

## THE REASONING

One pair is a proof of concept and a finite iterate needs a family. This is the family, and it is the last thing between the campaign and `powIter`.

## W3, THE WIDEST UNMEASURED TERM

The formula at a generic non-stage `y`. Estimate 130 to 280 lines, basis: agents/tasks/LJ-1-677/lj-1.677-report.md:1

## WHAT GO AND NO-GO EACH EARN

**GO** completes `Describes`, then `PowIter`, and two chapters stop assuming. **NO-GO** earns whether the generic case is FALSE while one instance is true, which is the sharpest possible statement about the tower.

## YOUR ROLE (program-generated, do not edit)

**You write the Agda this brief names, and the probe it names (A21).** The mathematician specifies; you build it and make it typecheck. Your report is the other half of that channel, so write what the next brief will need.

**THE RATIO BAR IS LIVE AND IT IS 0.0123 SECONDS PER IN-FENCE LINE.** A green return at or above that rate is ESCALATED to a critic by row `sys-dd24-ratio-bar`, which is DD24 restored by amendment A10. The divisor is fact 7, the in-fence line count of THIS task's write scope, counted the ledger's way: non-blank lines inside ` ```agda ` fences. **A raw `.agda` probe carries no fence and counts 0**, so the bar cannot fire on a probe and it binds the moment you write a `.lagda.md` master under `src/`. Design for it rather than discovering it: the number comes from `dev/pod/table.toml` at brief build, and its measured basis is in `dev/ledger.toml [ratio]`.

## LAWS (program-generated, do not edit)

MANDATORY for kind `recon` (read-only: an audit, a design pass, a history dig. It writes a report and nothing else. The sweep C-42 demands is a recon action, so this is that law's home bundle.):

- **D-10. Price the truth of a recorded residue before pricing its proof**
  **Rule:** A residue recorded under the wall protocol names a TARGET, and a target can be false; before dispatching a discharge batch, spend the five minutes checking the target's truth at the intended generality (a Tarskian or cardinality obstruction is the usual killer), and record the corrected target beside the original.
  Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:1375
- **C-22. A dispatched agent writes its deliverable incrementally, never at the end**
  **Rule:** When an agent's deliverable is a file, the brief must require it WRITTEN EARLY as a skeleton and filled incrementally, saving after each answer lands. An agent that researches for its whole budget and leaves the writing to the end returns nothing when the budget runs out, and its research dies with it. A partial dossier is a real deliverable; an unwritten perfect one is not.
  Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:2307
- **P-l. A statement may be ABOUT a concrete stage without dragging that stage's PRESENTATION into its type**
  **The law.** Being about a concrete position is not what costs. Naming a transparent construction in a statement's TYPE is. If the tower's stage values are `opaque` upstream, a theorem may quantify over, hypothesize about and conclude at `Sset ω` freely, because the stage is an ATOM to the elaborator and nothing unfolds. If instead the type mentions a transparent presentation, such as `⟪ sucV (...

- **D-26. A well-founded key on a tower needs generation data, or it needs syntax**
  **Rule:** When a route must well-order a cumulative tower's stage, ask first what the stage's members CARRY. A stage built as the values of finitely many total operations carries its own generation data, so a well-founded key exists with NO syntax at all: the operation index, then the arguments, ordered recursively. A stage built as a definable power carries nothing: its members are sets, not c...
  THIS IS AN EXCERPT. Full entry: dev/LESSONS.md:1735
- **C-42. A refutation measures the site it names, and it never measures how far that site extends**
  **Rule:** A refutation is a measurement of ONE site. It says the statement there is false. **It says nothing about how many other sites carry the same false shape.** So when a refutation lands, the next action is not the cure. **It is the sweep: search the tree for the shape, and report the COUNT before you price the cure.** A cure funded against the named site is priced against a number nobody...
